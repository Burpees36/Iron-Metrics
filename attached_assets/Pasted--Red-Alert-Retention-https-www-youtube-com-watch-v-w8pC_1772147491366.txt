## Phase 1 - Asses

The point of reaching out to the lead after they filled out, the info is solely to get them to sign up for a no sweat intro 

- It is not to go over all the different pricing options and get them to sign up for your program. Just get them to schedule a new sweat intro

 The NSI is really a motivational interview asking three or four questions to understand why they want to workout 

From there, it’s the coaches job to create a prescription to help get them the results the fastest way possible

- could be personal training,  semi private  training, group training, nutrition coaching, nutrition  challenge

The spreadsheet, as you can see has empty goal section, and that is because it’s meant to be filled out at the nose sweat intro, and every member will have their own sheet filled out for them

After their goals, they get an in body scan

If they are a competitive athlete or someone looking for high-end performance, they also  max heart rate

## Phase 2 - Admit and Affirm

present sales binder = show them the fastest way to get you where you want is…{blank}

you ask if this looks good, if they say it’s too expensive say okay given your budget we can do it this way, it isn’t going to be as fast but it will get you there

**goal of NSI** = get them signed up for the onramp program done 1-on-1

on ramp is a key in retention!

- some people view it as a barrier to entry but it’s really a barrier to exiting when done correctly

they should not leave the NSI without scheduling their first onramp appointment 

healthy habits appointment = go over nutrition habits that will help out in the long term

CSM position = client success manager 

- oversee each members journey over their first 90 days
- the ones to reach out and get those key touchpoints with clients

you want the time gap between NSI and first contact (first onboarding appointment, or healthy habits appointment) to be under 48 hours → you want it to be very very small 

- want to capitalize on momentum

## Phase 3 - Activate and Acclimate

typically have **healthy habits appointment** first 

- discuss importance of nutrition in achieving fitness goals
- provide reccomendations for first steps in habit change
- give them a habits tracking sheet (filled out from now until the end of on ramp and reviewed at the goal review session at end)
- last about 30 minutes and can be over the phone or zoom

CSM send client the sickness-wellness-fitness video with a script 

- sharing foundational CrossFit knowledge with clients!

Client should get the clients bill of rights and clients code of conduct → answers questions like “what do we do here?” , “what is 417?”, “how are we different?” 

- helps them feel like they fit in and don’t have any gaps like showing up late for their first class or whatever
- most quit because they don’t feel like they fit in so you want to make sure they feel like they belong

**1st Onramp workout**

- use the same workout and have a structure to it! any coach should be able to be plugged in and deliver a similar experience
- show them how to log scores into wodify or whatever software → help log them in and drive home importance of logging results (helps with retention too)
- assign some homework like stretching but it gets written down for them

follow up script after 1st workout

basically each onramp workout is used as a teaching opportunity to go over different movements they will frequently encounter at the gym, progress is tracked, there are follow ups after from the CSM asking about the workout and accompanied with a video for them to watch talking about various topics on nutrition, exercise, and so on

last workout they do is Fran where they get to experience some intensity for the first time and it’s just a classic workout that everyone in the CrossFit community knows and should do (helps feel apart of something)

all these sessions are done 1-on-1 and they are invited to try a group class after that if they want to 

- should get these 6 sessions done in 2 weeks and have a goal review at the end

goal review meeting (with coach who signed them up) 

- check the prescription → do you want to carry on 1-on-1 or do you want to go to a group? Do you want some more help with your nutrition or wait until we have a challenge come up?
- remember, goal of NSI is to book onramp and the goal of this goal review is to provide the best possible prescription for the client
- coach reviews their habits tracking sheet and that prescription will be called Rx1

## Phase 4 - Accomplish

the goal review mentioned above is really the turning point from phase 3 to 4 (doesn’t matter all that much)

at that meeting you get their recurring payment and book their next goal review session (90 days out) 

- get a follow up from CSM (with script)

CSM sends a 30 day check in (with script) congratulating them on their 1 month anniversary, asking how they are enjoying the program so far

also have a script for the 60 day check in, reminding them about goal review session

- if the client threw up a flag about something wrong during the 30 day review the CSM will check in with them weekly though

## Phase 5 - Adopt and Advocate

get another in body scan at the goal review, check in on their prescription, get their progress reviewed and ask if they are completely satisfied with their results → if yes…

ask for a testimonial! 

- can you share your story so other people can experience the results that you have
- if sharing your story can help one other person what would you tell them
- ask for referrals at this time!

going over their prescription (Rx2) → are they happy with their results? would private sessions help them? a nutrition challenge or coaching? It may be viewed as upselling but it’s really your duty as a coach to prescribe them what would help them the most. What would get them there faster? 

- upgrade membership if required, add supplement → if they are struggling getting protein offer what you sell, for instance (whatever you’re comfortable with here)

book next goal review & have another 30 and 60 day check in

- this process never really ends

you want to keep members at least 2 years so you’re not on this marketing treadmill and you can actually make an impact on people’s lives → goal reviews, check ins will help with retention and ARM

recommends doing it manually, refining it so that you love it and your clients love it before automating it with something like GLM
