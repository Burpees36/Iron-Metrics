Objective

For any given month, the system must:

Score all 13 interventions

Rank them by expected financial impact

Return:

Top 1: “If you do one thing this month…”

Top 3: Prioritized actions

Clear ROI math behind each

This becomes your strategic brain.

🧠 Core Scoring Formula (v1)

We calculate:

Intervention Score =
Expected Financial Impact
× Confidence Weight
× Urgency Factor
× Relevance Gate


Let’s define each.

1️⃣ Expected Financial Impact
For Retention Interventions
Expected Impact =
Members Affected
× ARM
× Expected Months Remaining
× Lift %


Where:

Members Affected = size of at-risk cohort

ARM = average revenue per member

Expected Months Remaining = conservative (ex: 6 months)

Lift % = baseline intervention lift

For Acquisition Interventions
Expected Impact =
Expected New Members
× ARM
× 6 months

For ARM Expansion (Nutrition)
Expected Impact =
Members Participating
× Expected ARM Increase
× 6 months

2️⃣ Confidence Weight

From earlier:

0.85 (highly reliable)

0.70 (moderate)

0.55 (variable)

This tempers inflated projections.

3️⃣ Urgency Factor

We now scale based on risk intensity.

Example logic:

Retention Rising Rapidly?
→ 1.3 multiplier

Retention Stable?
→ 1.0

Retention Improving?
→ 0.7

Acquisition Flat?
→ 1.2

Seasonal Relevance (Open near)?
→ 1.4

This gives context sensitivity without complexity.

4️⃣ Relevance Gate (Critical)

Intervention must only score if logically applicable.

Example:

Milestone Program only applies if tenure ≤120 days

Onboarding only applies if new_members > 0

Local Partnership only scores high if gym classified small-town

Open activation only scores during pre-season window

If not relevant:

Relevance Gate = 0


Intervention Score = 0.

This prevents garbage recommendations.

🔢 Example Walkthrough

Gym Data:

18 members in 0–90 days

ARM = $165

3-month churn rising

Lift = 6%

Confidence = 0.85

Urgency = 1.2

Members Saved:
18 × 0.06 = 1.08

Revenue Saved:
1.08 × 165 × 6 = $1,069

Score:
1069 × 0.85 × 1.2 = 1091

That becomes comparable against:

Referral Sprint Score
Attendance Recovery Score
Etc.

Now we rank.

🏗 Minimal Implementation Plan

You need:

1. Intervention Config Table

Hard-coded dictionary for now:

intervention = {
  "name": "",
  "type": "retention/acquisition/arm",
  "lift": 0.05,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "time_window": 60
}

2. Affected Cohort Functions

Examples:

get_new_members(gym_data)
get_at_risk_members(gym_data)
get_flat_growth_signal(gym_data)

3. Score Function
def score_intervention(intervention, gym_data):
    if not relevant(intervention, gym_data):
        return 0
    
    expected_impact = calculate_impact(intervention, gym_data)
    
    return expected_impact * intervention["confidence"] * urgency(gym_data)

4. Rank + Return Top 3

Sort descending.

Done.
