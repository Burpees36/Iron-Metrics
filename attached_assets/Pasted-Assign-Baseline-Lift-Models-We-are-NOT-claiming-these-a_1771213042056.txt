Assign Baseline Lift Models

We are NOT claiming these are universal truths.

These are:

Starting priors

Bayesian seeds

Adjustable as real gym data accumulates

Each intervention gets:

Primary Effect Type (Retention / Acquisition / ARM)

Typical Lift Range

Time to Impact

Confidence Weight (how predictable it is)

🛡 RETENTION INTERVENTIONS
1️⃣ New Member Onboarding Touchpoints

Primary Effect: Reduce 0–90 day churn
Typical Lift: 4–8% improvement in 90-day retention
Time to Impact: 30–60 days
Confidence: 0.85 (very reliable across gyms)

Reason:
Early relationship formation is universally powerful.

2️⃣ Member Engagement Check-In System

Primary Effect: Reduce mid-tenure churn
Typical Lift: 2–4% 6-month retention
Time to Impact: 30–90 days
Confidence: 0.65

Less dramatic than onboarding, but meaningful.

3️⃣ 90-Day Skill Milestone Program

Primary Effect: Reduce early churn
Typical Lift: 3–6% 3-month retention
Time to Impact: 45–75 days
Confidence: 0.75

Strong when culture already stable.

4️⃣ Attendance Recovery Sprint

Primary Effect: Reactivate drifters
Typical Lift:

20–30% of at-risk members reactivated
Effective churn reduction: ~2–5% overall

Time to Impact: 14–30 days
Confidence: 0.80

High short-term impact lever.

🚀 ACQUISITION INTERVENTIONS
5️⃣ Referral Activation Sprint

Primary Effect: New member growth
Typical Lift:
+1–3 members / 60 days (small gyms)
+3–6 members (mid-size gyms)

Confidence: 0.70
Time to Impact: 30–60 days

6️⃣ Bring-A-Friend System

Primary Effect: Ongoing small growth
Typical Lift:
+0.5–2 members / month sustained

Confidence: 0.60
Time to Impact: 30–90 days

Less explosive, more steady.

7️⃣ Social Proof Engine

Primary Effect: Lead generation
Typical Lift:
5–15% increase in inbound inquiries
Conversion dependent on sales system

Confidence: 0.55
Time to Impact: 60–120 days

Slower burn.

8️⃣ Local Partnership Activation

Primary Effect: Community-rooted acquisition
Typical Lift:
+2–5 members / 90 days (small-town bias)

Confidence:
0.80 small-town
0.40 urban

Time to Impact: 30–90 days

Archetype-sensitive.

🏆 COMMUNITY DEPTH
9️⃣ Event Activation System

Primary Effect:
6-month retention lift

Typical Lift:
3–7% retention increase among participants

Confidence: 0.75
Time to Impact: Seasonal (30–90 days)

🔟 Monthly Community Event Cadence

Primary Effect:
Belonging stabilization

Typical Lift:
1–3% retention improvement

Confidence: 0.60
Time to Impact: 60–120 days

1️⃣1️⃣ Nutrition Challenge Cycle

Primary Effect:
Retention + ARM expansion

Typical Lift:
2–4% retention
$20–$60 ARM increase (if upsold properly)

Confidence: 0.70
Time to Impact: 30–60 days

🎓 COACHING QUALITY
1️⃣2️⃣ Coaching Consistency Audit

Primary Effect:
Reduce long-term churn

Typical Lift:
2–5% 6–12 month retention

Confidence: 0.65
Time to Impact: 60–180 days

1️⃣3️⃣ Programming & Experience Audit

Primary Effect:
Reduce plateau churn

Typical Lift:
1–3% long-term retention

Confidence: 0.60
Time to Impact: 90–180 days

Slower but stabilizing.

🧮 What This Enables

Now your scoring engine can calculate:

Example:

If:

14 new members

ARM = $165

6-month LTV remaining = $990

Onboarding lift = 6%

Then:

Expected Retained Members:
14 × 0.06 = 0.84

Revenue Saved:
0.84 × $990 = $831

Now multiply by:
Confidence (0.85)
Urgency factor (if churn rising)

That becomes Intervention Score.

🔥 Important: These Are Priors

Once real data exists:

You update:

posterior_lift = (prior_weight × baseline_lift + observed_lift × data_weight)


This is how the system evolves.
