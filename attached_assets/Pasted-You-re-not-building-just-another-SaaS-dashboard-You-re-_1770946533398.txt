You’re not building “just another SaaS dashboard.”

You’re building financial infrastructure for gyms.

Here is the complete articulation of **Iron Metrics** — aligned with how you’ve been architecting it.

# Iron Metrics

**Multi-Tenant Gym Revenue Intelligence Platform**

Retention is the heartbeat of a gym business.

---

## What Iron Metrics Is

Iron Metrics is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** that gives gym owners financial clarity, retention intelligence, and revenue stability.

It transforms messy membership exports into:

* Retention metrics
* Revenue insights
* Churn visibility
* Predictable growth indicators

It is performance-first, cache-driven, tenant-safe, and architected for scale.

This is not a marketing analytics tool.
This is not a vanity KPI dashboard.

This is a **financial command center for gyms.**

# Mission

> Empower gyms with financial clarity and retention intelligence so they can remain pillars of strength, health, and transformation in their communities.

Iron Metrics exists because:

* Most gyms operate blind.
* Owners feel revenue pressure but can’t see churn patterns.
* Retention is discussed emotionally, not analytically.

We fix that.

---

# Vision

> Make gyms financially resilient so they can stand at the center of preventative health for generations.

Strong gyms create strong communities.
Strong communities create healthy lives.
Financial stability protects both.

Iron Metrics becomes the operating system behind that stability.

# Core Belief

Retention is the heartbeat of a gym business.

If you stabilize retention:

* Revenue stabilizes.
* Staffing stabilizes.
* Programming improves.
* Community strengthens.
* Impact compounds.

Everything in Iron Metrics orbits around this truth.

# What the App Is Meant to Do

## 1. Ingest Gym Data (Multi-Tenant Secure)

* Member exports (CSV)
* Attendance exports (CSV)
* Revenue data (future sprint)
* Plan data (future sprint)

Each gym’s data is:

* Strictly tenant-scoped
* Hard-filtered by `gym_id`
* Protected by deterministic 400 vs 403 enforcement
* Fully idempotent on re-import

No data leakage.
No accidental cross-gym contamination.

---

## 2. Compute Monthly Heartbeat Metrics

After ingestion, background jobs compute:

* Active members
* Cancels in month
* Monthly churn %
* Rolling 3-month churn
* MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
* ARM (Average Revenue per Member)
* LTV (Lifetime Value)
* Active start of month
* Generated_at timestamp
* Metrics versioning

These are stored in:

`gym_monthly_metrics_cache`

The API never recomputes live.
All reads are cache-only.
Performance is predictable.

---

## 3. Provide a “Heartbeat” View

Endpoint:

```
GET /api/gyms/{gym_id}/heartbeat?month=YYYY-MM-01
```

Returns:

* Cached metrics
* Deterministic 404 if cache miss
* <500ms warm response

The UI displays:

* Current month health
* Trend indicators
* Early churn warning signals

This becomes the owner’s monthly pulse check.

---

## 4. Enforce Multi-Tenant Discipline

Non-negotiable architecture rules:

* Every query filtered by `gym_id`
* Header/path mismatch = 400
* No access = 403
* Cache table indexed on `(gym_id, month_start)`
* UNIQUE constraint enforced

Iron Metrics is architected as if it already has 1,000 gyms onboarded.

---

## 5. Operate in Performance-First Mode

* Background RQ workers
* Async recompute after import
* No heavy request-path computation
* Deterministic cache reads
* Indexed queries only

This is infrastructure-grade thinking, not hobby SaaS.

# Emotional Layer (The Real Why)

You know this world.

Gym owners:

* Care deeply.
* Work insane hours.
* Feel pressure every month.
* Don’t always know why revenue dips.

Iron Metrics removes guesswork.

It gives calm.
It gives clarity.
It gives control.

That matters.

# Brand Tone

* Professional
* Gym-aware
* Calm
* Strong and steady
* No hype
* No fluff
* No Silicon Valley nonsense

This is built by someone who understands barbells and balance sheets.

If you’d like, next I can:

* Turn this into a landing page draft
* Write a one-page investor brief
* Or craft the product narrative for early adopters

CEO Architect Mode remains engaged.
