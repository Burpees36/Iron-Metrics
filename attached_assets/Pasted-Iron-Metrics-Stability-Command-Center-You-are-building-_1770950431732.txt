Iron Metrics — Stability Command Center

You are building a production-grade SaaS platform called Iron Metrics.

Iron Metrics is the Stability Command Center for CrossFit gyms.

It is not a generic analytics dashboard.

It is a financial resilience operating system designed to:

• Reduce revenue volatility
• Improve retention stability
• Lower owner stress
• Strengthen community longevity

The long-term evolution of this system is to become preventative care infrastructure.
But Phase 1 is CrossFit financial stability dominance.

Everything you build must align with that.

PRODUCT IDENTITY

Iron Metrics is the operating system for financially resilient gyms.

Retention is the heartbeat.
Community is the soul.
Stability is engineered.

The system must feel:

• Calm
• Minimal
• Structured
• Authoritative
• Precise
• Intentional

Not flashy.
Not startup-hyped.
Not cluttered.

PHASE 1 GOAL

Build the Stability Command Center for CrossFit gyms using Wodify-style data.

Core focus:
Retention + revenue stability + risk detection.

This is not a reporting tool.

It is a decision engine.

CORE MODULES TO BUILD
1. Retention Stability Index (Primary North Star)

Single composite score (1–100) based on:

• Monthly churn rate
• Early cancellation trends
• Membership age distribution
• Attendance decay patterns

Must show:

• Current score
• 90-day trend
• Target benchmark
• Clear interpretation
• Suggested action

2. Revenue Stability Panel

Metrics:

• Monthly churn %
• Net member growth
• Revenue per member
• Tier distribution
• Volatility indicator

Must include:

“What this means”
“Why it matters”
“What to do next”

No unexplained numbers.

3. Member Risk Radar

Predictive early-warning system:

Flag members based on:

• Attendance drop-off
• Tenure stage risk
• Payment irregularities
• Engagement decay

Must show:

• Risk tier (Low / Moderate / High)
• Intervention window recommendation
• Outreach priority ranking

This is proactive, not reactive.

4. Lifetime Value Engine

Calculate:

• True average LTV
• Revenue unlocked per 1% churn improvement
• Long-term revenue projection scenarios

Visualize:

“If churn decreases from 6.8% to 5%:

$X per year unlocked”

Make impact tangible.

5. Coach Impact Layer

Analyze:

• Class attendance retention by coach
• Engagement stickiness by class type
• Attendance patterns by time block

Important:

Do NOT frame as coach ranking.
Frame as retention leverage insight.

UI / UX REQUIREMENTS

Design philosophy:

Minimal dark interface
High contrast numbers
Deep steel blue accent
Generous whitespace

No cluttered charts.
No excessive animations.

Every metric block must contain:

• Metric value
• Target
• 90-day trend
• Interpretation
• Recommended action

If it doesn’t drive action, remove it.

FEATURE FILTER

Before implementing any feature, validate:

Does this improve financial stability?

Does this improve retention clarity?

Does this reduce owner stress?

Does this strengthen community longevity?

If no — exclude.

DATA ARCHITECTURE (IMPORTANT)

Design system to support:

• Multi-tenant gyms
• Strict data isolation
• Cache-driven metric reads
• Nightly recalculations
• Background job processing
• Fast <500ms dashboard load

Prepare schema to expand later into:

• Health engagement metrics
• Employer wellness integration
• Longitudinal community impact tracking

Future-proof architecture now.

TONE OF COPY

All product copy must be:

Declarative
Calm
Minimal
Authoritative

Avoid:

Exclamation points
Marketing hype
“Scale fast” language
Growth hacker tone

We are building financial discipline software.

LONG-TERM ARCHITECTURE PREPARATION

Design in a way that future modules can support:

• Preventative care adherence scoring
• Employer partnership dashboards
• Community health impact analytics
• Retention-health correlations

But do NOT build those yet.

Just architect clean expansion paths.

PRODUCT NORTH STAR

Success =

If a gym improves retention by 1–2%:

• Revenue volatility drops
• Owner stress drops
• Coach stability improves
• Member consistency improves
• Community longevity increases

That is success.

Not feature count.
Not dashboard complexity.

Stability is strategy.
Stability is engineered.

FINAL INSTRUCTION TO BASE44

Build Iron Metrics as:

The Stability Command Center for CrossFit gyms.

Not an analytics dashboard.
Not a consulting tool.

Build infrastructure.

Minimal.
Precise.
Action-driven.
Future-proof.
