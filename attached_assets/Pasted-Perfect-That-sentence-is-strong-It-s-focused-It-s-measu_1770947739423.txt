Perfect.

That sentence is strong.

It’s focused.
It’s measurable.
It’s not fluffy.
It sounds like infrastructure.

Now we build everything around that.

# 4️⃣ Standardized Data Schema (Critical)

You need a standard schema from Day 1.

Member Table:

* member_id
* join_date
* cancel_date
* membership_type
* monthly_price
* status

Attendance Table:

* member_id
* class_date
* class_type
* coach_id

Revenue Table:

* member_id
* billing_month
* revenue_amount

Coach Table:

* coach_id
* hire_date
* class_types

This is the backbone.

Future SaaS depends on this structure.

# Now — Your Original Question

Yes.

Building this documentation first is exactly what you should do.

Because now you can plug this into AI and say:

“Build me a Streamlit dashboard that calculates the Retention Stability Index, Revenue Efficiency Score, Lifetime Value Engine, Coach Impact Index, and Member Risk Radar using this schema.”

That prompt will work.

Without this clarity, it wouldn’t.

---

Now here’s the next level question:

Do you want Iron Metrics to feel:

A) Analytical & institutional
or
B) Performance-driven & athletic

This affects branding, tone, and even dashboard design language.
